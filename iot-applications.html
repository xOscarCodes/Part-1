    <h1>Activity 1</h1>
    <p>IoT apps are software programmes that run on IoT devices or connect different IoT devices. IoT applications serve
      a specific purpose in different industries, including home automation, wearable devices, automotive, etc. Some
      main features of an IoT application are intelligence, security, scalability, environmental or human data, etc.</p>

    <h1>Activity 2</h1>
    <p>Smart means an intelligent application that can collect and monitor data and take independent actions (the
      sense-think-Act paradigm). Additionally, it can also have the ability to learn from and adapt to the collocated
      data. Smart buildings are needed in places with a high population density for real-time monitoring, places with
      varying climates, places like nuclear power plants with emergency response, sustainable management, etc. Some main
      features of smart buildings include: automation which include systems like automated lighting system, centralized
      control: a single system or interface to manage every smart device in the building, efficiency: to save energy,
      connectivity: to provide real-time data collection and processing, security: biometric security measures, control
      access of assets and cameras for surveillance.</p>

  <div class="section three" id="A3">
    <h1>Activity 3</h1>
    <p>Some high level features of control interface are interactive UI, login capabilities: to prevent unauthorized
      access, real-time: the control interface should provide real time data to the users, emergency response,
      reporting: need in case of any failure of system or hazardous event, automation: ability to automate certain
      tasks. The users of the control interface can be employees, customers, residents, or visitors. To develop and
      deploy this system, we need sensors such as temperature, humidity, etc. to collect building data; a user interface
      to interact with a single or multiple smart devices; and connectivity to connect all the devices with the
      interface.</p>
